Particles are standalone.
Entities are standalone, or depend on particles.

White hole depends on Particles to exist.
Black hole depends on Particles to exist.

Genome depends on Entities existing.
Gene Manager depends on Genome.

Stage and GameBoard are containers more than anything.

-----


Game Board
- Contains the Stage, and all Genomes, as well as the graphical background.
- Also contains active particles.

Stage
- Contains entities, which are static and not manipulated by genomes.
- If activated, it tells it's entities to activate, namely white hole.

-GeneManager - Singleton
- which tells which genomes to be overwritten, which to mutate, and sorts them by score and so on.
- Can Evaluate, which tells a Genome, and the Stage to evaluate, allowing the genome to learn it's fitness score.

Genome
- Contains entities, and knows how to tell them to mutate when the Genemanager says so.
- Can be overwritten by another genome.
- Tracks it's own fitness score.
----
- Tells Entities to mutate. Tells entities to mimic another entity (if self overwritten)
- Can be activated, activating all sub entities. 

Entity
-Entity Subtypes. Rectangle, Attractor, rotator, blackhole/ whitehole, etc.
-- Rectangles are just box colliders that bound particles off of them.
-- Attractors apply an attractive/repulsive Force
-- Rotators rotate the motion vector of any particle inside them.


Black Hole
- The goal of particles. ACtive Genome gains score when a particle touches it, based on how much life it has left.

White Hole
- The source of Particles. Generates a large number and sends them in all directions.

Particle
- Physics rigidbody which interacts with entities, and has a limited lifespan. Destroyed if it leaves the bounds, or touches a blackhole.


-----
Extra Stuff

Graph
-Shows data on genomes, history, ages, etc? Dunno yet, figure out later, after functionality exists.


-----

Particle
-Has a position and a movement vector
-Can move as time elapses.
Test by
-Create several and check that vector distance from source after 1 second is roughly expected distance and direction.

Entity
-Base Class of several object types.
-Has Location.
-Can effect Particles intersecting, entering, or leaving it's area.

White Hole.
-Is an "Entity"
-Can produce particles on invoke
Test By
-Create one, and invoke it. Count particle produced, and final positions after 1 second.

Black Hole
-Is an "Entity"
-Can Destroy Particles on Contact.
Test By
-Create one, and several particles directed towards and away from it. Ensure that particles intersecting with it are destroyed, and those not intersecting are not destroyed.

Game Board
-Is play area.
-Can destroy particles on leaving collision area.
Test By
-As black hole.


Accelerator
-Is an "Entity"
-Has size (Circle Collision Area)
-Has acceleration Vector (Positive or negative, always away from center of object)
-Can accelerate Particles inside collision area.

Test By
-Create several, with varying traits and overlaps. Create particles, set to intersect and not intersect with each, and to intersect with several. Ensure particles end up in expected positions after ~5 seconds.

Rotator
-Is an "Entity"
-Has size (Circle Collision Area)
-Has Torque/Rotation over time, (Positive or negative)
-Can turn Particles inside collision area. (Rotating their movement Vector)

Test By 
-Same as Accelerator

Wall
-Is an "Entity"
-Has size (X/Y, box collision, optionally rotation as well)
-Particles entering collision area are deflected as a bounce type effect with 100% elasticity.

Test By
-Same as Accelerator.


Genome
-Contains list of entities.
-
